## Predicting Credit Default.
#### Identifying risky credit patterns

We'll be analyzing credit card data, collected in Taiwan (link below). Trying to predict patterns that lead to defaulting on credit. Various Machine Learning methods will be applied to the dataset. We will also try to derive some features to help our predictions. The 'real world' applications of these methods will be considered throughout our report. Balancing accuracy and the rate of true positive predictions will be the main consideration throughout the report.
